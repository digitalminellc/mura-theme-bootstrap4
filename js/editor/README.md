# js/editor

All files in the `js/editor` directory are intended to override default [CKEditor](https://ckeditor.com) behavior. You can add styles to `styles.js`, add templates to `templates/default.js` & `dialogs/templates.js`, and configure CKEditor itself by editing `config.js.cfm` per the [CKEditor documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/).

Any file ending with `.cfm` can be used to add dynamic or conditional behavior via CFML.
